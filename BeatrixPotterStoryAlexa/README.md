This is a first release of an Alexa skill I've written that will tell the user a Beatrix Potter story. Currently the story is chosen at random. Very bare bones at this point. Will add more functionality later. 
Many Beatrix Potter stories go over the response limit set by Amazon. Later I plan to allow for longer stories but for now it will only tell the shorter ones. 

This could be easily modified to use your own stories or any stories in the public domain. Many can be found here: https://www.gutenberg.org/

https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-csharp-fact is a project that can walk you through the configuration you will have to follow for deploying your skill to AWS Lambda.
