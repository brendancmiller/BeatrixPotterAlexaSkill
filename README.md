This is a first release of an Alexa skill I've written that will tell the user a Beatrix Potter story. Currently the story is chosen at random. Very bare bones at this point. Will add more functionality later. 
 
 NOTE: The skill in it's current state was not accepted into the Alexa store. The reviewer felt that it was too close to an audiobook so rejected the submission and suggested I go that route.

https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-csharp-fact is a project that can walk you through the configuration you will have to follow for deploying your skill to AWS Lambda.
